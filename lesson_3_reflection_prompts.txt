When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
>>>When Some code is supposed to be shared be fellow programmers, which I can not do all by myself.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
>>>people might do some changes which we might not want to take. So manully deciding is better.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
>>>Branch is the code changes tracked using versions in the repository that are connected.
>>>Clone is used to clone a repository from local to local or remote to local or local to remote.
>>> fork is used same as clone but only remote to remote.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
>>>I case of conflicts it's easy to fetch to the last known state of remote and then merge the remote copy and local master to get the code synced.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
>>>Easier thing would be the sharability of code and a lot of ideas.
>>> harder thing would be to keep track of everything as it will get messy as more people start contributing.

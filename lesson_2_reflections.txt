What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It creates the meta data for the files present in the directory. Its needed for git to maintain the repository and revisions.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It's the intermediary between PWD and repository. It doesn't change the commit history and can be reverted without any changes. But can be shared for code reviews etc.
